# breast-cancer-classification
Machine learning technique (SVM) was able to classify tumors into Malignant/Benign with 97% accuracy.
This technique can rapidly evaluate breast masses and classify them in an automated fashion.
Early breast cancer can dramatically save lives especially in the developing world.
The technique can further improved by combining Computer Vision/ML techniques to directly classify cancer using tissue images.
